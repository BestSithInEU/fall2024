   cd fall2024
   ```

## Staying Updated

To get the latest updates:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Important Guidelines

- Always attempt to solve assignments independently before checking solutions
- Review the code documentation to understand the implementation
- Keep your local copy updated by pulling regularly
- Getting Help

1. During lab sessions - direct questions are welcome
2. Via GitHub:
   - Go to repository page
   - Click on "Issues" tab
   - Click "New Issue" to ask questions
3. [Email me](mailto:bedguer@cse.yeditepe.edu.tr) for urgent matters

Remember: These solutions are meant to guide your learning journey, not replace your own problem-solving efforts. Understanding the underlying concepts is crucial for your academic and professional development.

Good luck with your studies!
